# Discussion: Internal

__Private__ discussion will be held in [the Issues](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion-Internal/issues) of this repository. To start a new thread, create a new issue. 

Use this to discuss course-specific things that are _not_ relevant to the public. Examples of discussion topics:

- Office hours
- Assignment clarifications
- Class meetings

Examples of discussion topics best left for the public [Discussion](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion) repository (because then the public can benefit from your question, too):

- Help with coding problems
- Installation issues
- Other types of computational problems

Lots of the good stuff will end up in [closed Issues](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion-Internal/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed), so don't forget to look there! Or, more generally, use the "Search" feature on this repository to find things.
